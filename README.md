# Chobble Clients Template

This repository builds a site based on the [Chobble Template](https://git.chobble.com/chobble/chobble-template/)

It copies that template (except the Markdown files) and then copies the contents of this repo into the `src` folder

This means most of the Eleventy / Liquid / Nix complexity can be hidden from non-technical users who only ever need to edit the Markdown files and images
