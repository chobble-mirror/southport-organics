Deeply cleanse, tone & revitalise skin with this gorgeously gift wrapped set containing a Calming Lava Clay & Organic Oatmeal Facial Mask complete with facial spa accessories, and an indulgent creamy Lip Balm made with organic Cocoa Butter, Jojoba Oil & natural Peppermint Essential Oil!

Each individual mask sachet contains at least four applications meaning this long lasting set contains at least four facials!

Bursting with vitamins and minerals, these diy powder masks are fully customisable for an interactive spa-like experience. Mix with cooling and de-puffing cold water, or use with warm water to open pores and ease tension. Other skin safe liquids may be used instead of water, such as Aloe Vera Juice, Oat Milk, Coconut Water or cooled herbal teas such as Chamomile or Green Tea.
