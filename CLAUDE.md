# Markdown Formatting Rules

When working with product markdown files for Southport Organics, apply these formatting rules to improve readability while preserving all original content:

## Headings

1. Use `##` (H2) for main section headings:

   - "Contents"
   - "Indulge in a blissful soak"
   - "Complete your spa-inspired experience"
   - "Product details"
   - Any other major sections

2. Use `###` (H3) for subsections when needed

## Lists

1. Format product contents as bulleted lists with `-` prefix:

   ```markdown
   - 300g Glass Jar of Organic Bath Salts
   - 20g Organic Clay Facial Mask
   ```

2. Format options and product details with `*` prefix:

   ```markdown
   - 😴 Deep Calm (Lavender)
   - 🌹 Wild Rose (Rose Geranium)
   ```

3. Add a space after emojis in list items for better readability:
   ```markdown
   - 🍊 Free from artificial fragrance
   ```

## Spacing

1. Add blank lines between sections for better readability
2. Add blank lines before and after headings
3. Add blank lines before and after lists
4. Ensure consistent spacing around headers and content blocks

## Content Structure

1. Group related information under appropriate headings
2. Maintain the logical flow of the original content
3. For emoji-heavy content, organize into bulleted lists
4. For technical details and features, use bulleted lists

## Important Note

Never modify the actual product content or meaning - only improve the formatting and structure.
