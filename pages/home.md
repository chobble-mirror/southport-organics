## 💫 Luxury, Organic, Handmade Cosmetics

Hello, my names Jem! 🌙

At Southport Organics I craft Natural, Organic, Earth & Animal Friendly Cosmetics here by the sea in Southport. Inspired by the magic of nature, which isn’t hard here with vast beaches, the Irish sea, pinewoods, dunes and surrounding countryside, I'm passionate about self care and believe that we should take care of Nature too. I use only the highest quality ingredients, organic where possible, from trusted and ethical suppliers.

I'm also passionate about animal rights which is why all products are Vegan & Cruelty Free as well as donating to animal charities each month.

Thank you for supporting my small business! 🐰
