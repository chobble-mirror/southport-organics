## Luxury, Organic, Handmade Cosmetics

Southport Organics is a family business crafting natural, organic, Earth & animal friendly cosmetics here by the Irish Sea & vast pine woods of Southport. Inspired by the magic of nature, and passionate about self care, we believe that we should take good care of our planet too. We use only the highest quality ingredients, organic where possible, from trusted and ethical suppliers.
