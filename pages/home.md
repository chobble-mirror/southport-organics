Luxury, Organic, Handmade Cosmetics

Southport Organics is a family business crafting natural, organic, cosmetics here by the Irish Sea & vast pine woods of Southport. Inspired by the magic of nature, and passionate about self care, we believe that we should take good care of our planet and the animals too which is why all of our products are vegan, cruelty free and Earth conscious! We use only the highest quality ingredients, organic where possible, all of our beautiful gift wrapping and postal packaging is 100% plastic free, and we also donate to a different animal charity each month. Are you in need of a skincare overhaul? Looking for the perfect gift complete with a hand written message? We've got you! Welcome, please take a look around!
