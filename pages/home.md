# Luxury, Organic, Handmade Cosmetics

Southport Organics is a family-run business creating natural, organic cosmetics by the Irish Sea and the sandy beaches and vast pine woods of Southport. Inspired by the magic of nature and a passion for self-care, we believe in caring for our planet and its animals too. That's why all of our products are vegan, cruelty-free, and Earth-conscious!

We use only the highest quality ingredients - organic wherever possible - and all of our beautiful gift wrapping and postal packaging is 100% plastic-free. We also donate to a different animal charity each month!

Whether you're looking for luxurious natural skincare or a beautifully wrapped gift complete with a handwritten note, our collection offers luxury skincare, bath, and body hand crafted with care. Welcome!
